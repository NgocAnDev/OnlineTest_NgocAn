# My Challenges Repository

This repository contains solutions for two different challenges:
 **Challenge 1 - Basic Mobile App**: A basic mobile app built with Kotlin for Android. 
 **Challenge 2 - Problem Solving**: Solutions for problems related to arrays and product inventory management, implemented in Dart.

## Challenge 1 - Basic Mobile App (Kotlin, XML)
### Overview
This is a simple mobile app built with Kotlin for Android. It uses XML for designing the user interface in Android Studio. The app demonstrates basic functionalities like user input, displaying results, and basic interaction with the UI.
### How to Run
 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
 2. Open the `Challenge1_BasicMobileApp` folder in Android Studio.
 3. Ensure that you have the necessary Android SDK installed.
 4. Build and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.

## Challenge 2 - Problem Solving (Dart)
### Overview
This section contains solutions to two problems: **Product Inventory Management** and **Array Manipulation and Missing Number Problem**. These problems are solved using Dart, and the solutions are structured in separate folders.

### 2.1 Product Inventory Management (Dart)
This solution implements a product inventory management system. It allows users to manage a list of products and perform various operations such as calculating the total inventory value, sorting by price or quantity, and checking if a product is in stock.

### How to Run (Challenge 2.1)
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Challenge2_ProblemSolving` folder in VSCode.
3. Open the `2.1_ProductInventoryManagement` folder in VSCode.
4. Ensure that you have the Dart SDK installed.
5. Run the respective `main.dart` file in each challenge to test the solutions.

### 2.2 Array Manipulation and Missing Number Problem (Dart)
This solution solves a problem where we are given an array of integers, and we need to find the missing number from the series.

#### Key Function:
- `findMissingNumber(List<int> numbers)`: This function finds the missing number in a list of consecutive integers.

### How to Run (Challenge 2.2)
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Challenge2_ProblemSolving` folder in VSCode.
3. Open the `2.2_FindMissingNumber` folder in VSCode.
4. Ensure that you have the Dart SDK installed.
5. Run the respective `main.dart` file in each challenge to test the solutions.


## Additional Notes
- Challenge 1 demonstrates basic mobile app development with Kotlin and XML.
- Challenge 2 focuses on solving algorithmic problems using Dart.
